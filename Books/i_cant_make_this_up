Summary:
* One thing that led to the most success in his life is to be fun, and not necessarily funny.
* People want you to do things up until the point they lose control of you. If you start pulling away or becoming more successful, your dream will become their threat.
* Easiest way to sabotage a career is to refuse to do anything unless you are compenstated or rewarded directly for it. Working hard is not directly rewarded by success.
  * Key factor to success - commitment
  * I've seen this same advice echoed in so many places: key to success is to give without the expectation of reward.

Quotes:
* "If you wait for certainty, you will spend your whole life standing still. And if you grow discouraged and give up when things get rough, you'll miss out on your best possible destiny. So the secret is to be excited about what is in your power to control, be accepting of what's not in your power to control, and then move with certainty into an uncertain future."
* "Around the time you're eighteen, nature stops the process of growing in your body. So if you want to keep growing after that, you have no choice but to stretch yourself on your own and increase your thinking, your capabilities, and your accomplishments."
* "Blame yourself for following the advice of a guy who tells jokes for a living."

Notes:
* The first 66% of the book is very good. It's his story of growing up and getting noticed along with all the struggles to get there.
  * Most of the last 33% is just about being famous and successful - almost basking in it.
* Overall, I thought it was an enjoyable read as a lens into someone elses life. In terms of insight into my own life, however, there isn't much.
