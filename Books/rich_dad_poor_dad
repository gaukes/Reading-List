Summary:
* Only rule you need to know: the difference between an asset and a liability. Buy assets.
  * Assets make you money.
  * Liabilities take money from you.
* An asset is anything that has value, produces income or appreciates and has a ready rate.
* 7 types of assets:
  * Businesses that do not require presence. Owned but not managed.
  * Stocks.
  * Bonds.
  * Mutual funds.
  * Income-generating real estate.
  * Notes (IOUs).
  * Royalties from intellectual property.
    * Ex: music, scripts, patents.
* Things that most people consider assets are not. Ex: a house.
  * Every month, are you making or losing money from your house? For most people, it's the latter.
* The No.1 expense for most people is taxes.
  * For most people, the biggest component is actually Social Security.
    * You pay 7.5% and your employer matches for 15%.
    * The 7.5% your employer pays is money they can't pay you.
* Two ways to get rich:
  * Start early and invest safe.
  * Invest risky and win.
* If the cash flow from assets is bigger than all expenses, you are financially independent.
  * You no longer need to work to live.
  * Only grow expenses (w/ luxeries) after growing assets.
* Financial IQ is composed of expertise in:
  * Accounting.
  * Investing.
  * Understanding markets.
    * Two parts: "technical" (emotional-driven) and "fundamental" (sense-driven).
  * The law.
* Better products do not always win. Better businesses do.
  * Ex: McDonald's wins because it is a real estate company that also sells burgers.
* Corporations come with many benefits.
  * Ex: lower tax rate, risk management, tax profit (not revenue), etc.
* How to look for new ideas: go to bookstores and look for books on different and unique subjects.
  
Quotes:
* "There is another horrible management theory that goes, 'Workers work hard enough to not get fired, and owners pay just enough so that workers won't quit." And if you look at the pay scales of most companies, again I would say there is a degree of truth in that statement."
* "Search, offer, reject, negotiate and accept are all parts of the process of almost everything in life."

Notes:
* Much of the book is a series of stories mixed with thoughts/ advise. It's hard to say there is a coherent pattern/plan.
  * Intro alludes to this that the book was made from random thoughts of the author collected together by a writer.
* There are tidbits of solid advise but a lot of hand-wavy arguments.
* This guy respects Donald Trump way too much.
